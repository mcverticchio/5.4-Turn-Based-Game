## 5.4 Turn Based Game

Description: 
I created a turn-based attack game in partnership with lonate12. 
This assignment enabled me to use yeoman and front end scaffolding, practice with constructors and prototypes, and understand how and why to use prototypical inheritance.

Tech: Javascript/Jquery, HTML/CSS/SCSS, yeoman generator
